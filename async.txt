 promise.finally()
 --It occurs eventhough the promise is resolved or rejected.It always happens.
 promise.race()
 -This returned promise settles with the eventual state of the first promise that settles faster.
promise.reject()
-The Promise.reject() static method returns a Promise object that is rejected with a given reason.
promise.resolve()
-If the value is a promise, that promise is returned; if the value is a thenable, Promise.resolve() will call the then() method with two callbacks it prepared; otherwise the returned promise will be fulfilled with the value.
